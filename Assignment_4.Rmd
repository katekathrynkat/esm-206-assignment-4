###Part 1. Lobster abundance and fishing pressure (2012 - 2017)

**Ken:** Best way to depict these data?
1. Table of summary statistics for abundance and fishing data at each site
2. Figures of abundance at each site and fishing pressure (5 column graphs with abundance = column, and lines for fishing pressure)

```{r abundance: standardize for effort, include=FALSE}

# Create data frame of effort: number of transects surveyed at each site for each year

lob_effort <- size %>% 
  group_by(SITE, YEAR) %>% 
  summarize(effort = length(unique(SBC_LTER_TRANSECT)))

# Create data frame of abundance: total number of indv found at each site for each year

lob_n <- size2 %>% 
  group_by(site, year) %>% 
  summarize(raw_n = length(size))

# Combine effort and abundance data frames

abundance <- full_join(lob_n, lob_effort,
                by = c('site'='SITE', 'year'='YEAR')) %>% # combine effort and abundance data frames
  mutate(n = raw_n/effort) %>% # add column for abundance adjusted for effort
  full_join(., MPAs, by = 'site') # add MPA information

```


```{r abundance: scatter plot per site over time, echo=FALSE}

###Part 2. Mean lobster size by site in 2017

```{r size: data distribution and variance, include=FALSE}

# Data frame for 2017 data only
size2017 <- size2 %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>%  # keeps only 2017
  select (year, site, size, MPA)

# Histogram of size by site
size_2017_hist<- ggplot(size2017, aes(x = size)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = site)) +
  facet_wrap(~ site, scale = "free")

size_2017_hist

# qq-plot of size by site
qq_size2017<- ggplot(size2017, (aes(sample= size))) +
  geom_qq(aes(color = site)) +
  facet_wrap(~site, scale = "free")

qq_size2017

# based on qqplots and histograms observations for each group appear normally distrubuted. Also, n > 30 for all groups, so means will be normally distrubuted



# Variance of size by site

# Levene Test 
# leveneTest() function in the 'car' package
# H0: No difference in variances (variances are equal)
# HA: Variances are NoT equal

levene_size2017 <- leveneTest(size ~ site, data = size2017)

levene_size2017
# There is a significant difference in variances across species

# Actual variances:
variances <- size2017 %>% 
  group_by(site) %>% 
  summarize(
    variance = var(size)
    )

variances

# the largest variance (205.1)(IVEE) is definately not 4x greater than the smallest variance (86.1)(MOHK)
# If the largest sample variances is < 4x greater than the smallest sample variance, then these are "close enough" to consider variances equal for ANOVA

```


```{r size: summary stats, echo=FALSE}

# summary statistics for 2017 carapace size

size_sum <- size2017 %>% 
  group_by(site) %>% 
  summarize(
    Mean = round(mean(size), 2), # (mm)
    SD = round(sd(size), 2),
    n = length(size)) %>% 
  rename(Site = site) %>% 
  mutate(
    Site = case_when(
      Site == "AQUE" ~ "Arroyo Quemado", 
      Site == "CARP" ~ "Carpinteria", 
      Site == "IVEE" ~ "Isla Vista", 
      Site == "MOHK" ~ "Mohawk", 
      Site == "NAPL" ~ "Naples")) 

table_caption <- '**Table 1.** **California spiny lobster (*Panulirus interruptus*) Carapace Length (mm) Recorded at five sites in the Santa Barbara Channel (2017).** Mean, standard deviation, and sample size of Carapace Length (mm) Recorded at five sites in the Santa Barbara Channel in 2017. Data retrieved from The Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research Project.' 

table_colnames <-c('Site', 'Mean', 'SD', 'n') 

size_anova_tab <-kable(size_sum,
                       caption = table_caption,
                       col.names = table_colnames,
                     align = c('l','c','c','c')) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),  
                full_width = FALSE)  


size_anova_tab

```


```{r size: ANOVA and post-hoc tests, include=FALSE}

# HO: The means across all groups are equal
# HA: At least two means differ

size2017_anova <- aov(size ~ site, data = size2017)

summary(size2017_anova)

# there's at least one sig diff!!

# post-hoc testing: Tukey's HSD 
size2017_ph <- TukeyHSD(size2017_anova)

size2017_ph
# significant differences between:
# 1. NAPL and CARP
# 2. NAPL and IVEE

```

Satisfy the conditions of parametric tests (normal distribution, equal variance), so used ANOVA and Tukey's HSD. Only found significantdifferences between:

1. NAPL and CARP
2. NAPL and IVEE

```{r size: boxplot, echo=FALSE}

site_names <- c("Arroyo Quemado", "Carpinteria", "Isla Vista", "Mohawk", "Naples")

size_anova <- ggplot(size2017, aes(x = site, y = size)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = MPA)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('grey', 'white')) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = site_names) +
  labs(x = "Site", y = "Carapace Length (mm) (n = 1668)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

###Part 3. Changes in lobster size at MPA and non-MPA sites for 2012 and 2017

```{r MPA: data frames, include=FALSE}

# Create data frame for 2012, 2014, MPA data only
size_2012_2017_MPA <- size2 %>% 
  filter(year == "2012" | year == "2017") %>%  # keeps only 2012 and 2017
  filter(site == "IVEE" | site == "NAPL") %>% #keeps the MPAs
  select (year, site, size) %>%  # selects '12 and '17, 5 sites, and size
  group_by(year)

# Individual data frame for 2012

MPA2012 <- size_2012_2017_MPA  %>% 
  filter(year == "2012") %>%    # keeps only 2012
  pull (size)

# Individual dataframe for 2017

MPA2017 <- size_2012_2017_MPA  %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>%    # keeps only 2017
  pull (size)
  
```

```{r MPA: t-test , include = FALSE}

# F-test for equal variances between 2012 and 2017

var.test(MPA2012,MPA2017, data = .) # F-test

# Variances are the same --> use a student's t (override Welch approx)

# t-test
# 2-sided, 2-sample t-test between 2012 and 2017

MPA_2012_2017_t <- t.test(MPA2012, MPA2017, var.equal = TRUE)

MPA_2012_2017_t
# no significant difference

```


```{r non-MPA: data frames, include=FALSE}

# Create data frame for 2012, 2014, non-MPA data only

size_2012_2017_NON <- size2 %>% 
  filter(year == "2012" | year == "2017") %>%  # keeps only 2016
  filter(site == "MOHK" | site == "CARP" | site == "AQUE") %>% # keeps the non-MPAs
  select (year, site, size) %>%  # selects '12 and '17, 5 sites, and size
  arrange(site)

# Individual dataframe for 2012

NON2012 <- size_2012_2017_NON  %>% 
  filter(year == "2012") %>%    # keeps only 2012
  pull (size) # keeps only size

# Individual dataframe for 2017

NON2017 <- size_2012_2017_NON  %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>%    # keeps only 2017
  pull (size) # keeps only size
  
```

```{r non-MPA: t-test, include=FALSE}

# F-test for equal variances between 2012 and 2017

var.test(NON2012,NON2017, data = .) # F-test

# Variances are the same --> use a student's t (override Welch approx)

# t-test
# 2-sided, 2-sample t-test between 2012 and 2017

NON_2012_2017_t <- t.test(NON2012, NON2017, data = ., var.equal = TRUE)

NON_2012_2017_t
# there IS a sig diff

```


```{r non-MPA: effect size, include=FALSE}

# Effect size of the differences of size 2012 vs 2017

Cohen_d <- cohen.d(NON2012, NON2017)

Cohen_d

#(Cohen's d = 0.21)
# Absolute difference 2012 = 74.92 to 2017 = 72.3

```

Variances were equal, so used student's t-test to compare 2012 and 2017 and Cohen's d to calculate effect size. Results:

**MPAs:** NO significant change in sizes from 2012 to 2017.

**non-MPAs:** significant change change in sizes from 2012 to 2017

- effect size is small
- actual difference: 2012 = 74.92, 2017 = 72.3


###Part 4. Proportions of “legal” lobsters at the 5 sites in 2017

```{r legality: data frame, echo=FALSE}

size_legal <- size2 %>% 
  filter(year == 2017) %>% 
  mutate(legal = case_when(
    size>82.6 ~ 'Y',
    size<82.6 ~ 'N'
  )) %>% 
  select(site, legal)

legal <- table(size_legal)

legal

```


```{r legality: chi-square, include=FALSE}

# Chi-square test

size_chi <- chisq.test(size_legal$site, size_legal$legal)

size_chi
# significant association between site and size

```

Ran chi-square on site vs. size and found a significant difference.
